# Northwestern Admissions Statistics

ABOUT THIS PROGRAM:

Because there are no cumulative admission statistics of Northwestern undergraduates from the years 2000 to 2021 and it is Common App season, I created a program that analyzes data from Northwestern to calculate and graph admission statistics for users to utilize to estimate their chances of admission. This program showcases the percentage of male, female, and total admitted students in addition to their average SAT and ACT scores over the time period 2000 to 2021. 

HOW TO USE: 

If the method Professor Marano uses to run this program does not work at first, download the Admit_Rate.csv, Scores.csv, and GraceTsengPython.ipynb.  Copy the code into colabs from GraceTsengPython.ipynb and upload the files needed to run the program (Admit_Rate.csv and Scores.csv) under contents section. THANK YOU FOR USING!
